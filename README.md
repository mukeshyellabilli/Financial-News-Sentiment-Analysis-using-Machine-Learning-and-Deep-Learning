# Financial News Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on financial news articles to classify their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral). The goal is to understand how news can influence the financial markets and make better investment decisions by predicting the impact of news on stock prices.

## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing the emotional tone behind a body of text. In this project, we apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify financial news articles as positive, negative, or neutral. The aim is to use sentiment analysis to help traders, investors, and analysts make informed decisions based on the sentiment conveyed by news articles.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of financial news articles, typically collected from sources such as financial news websites, or APIs like NewsAPI or Yahoo Finance. Each news article is associated with a label indicating its sentiment, usually as:
- Positive
- Negative
- Neutral

Key features in the dataset include:
- **News Headline/Content**: The text of the news article or headline.
- **Sentiment Label**: The sentiment associated with the article (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Date**: The date the article was published (optional).

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collecting financial news articles from various sources.
   - Text preprocessing: 
     - Tokenization
     - Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
     - Lemmatization or stemming.
   - Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing the distribution of sentiments.
   - Word clouds and frequency analysis of key terms in positive, negative, and neutral news.
   - Visualizing class imbalances and patterns in the data.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Applying machine learning and deep learning models to predict sentiment based on financial news.
   - Implementing model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Machine Learning Models
The project applies several machine learning models for sentiment classification, including:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model for binary and multiclass classification.
2. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Commonly used for text classification due to its probabilistic approach.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A robust model that tries to find a hyperplane to classify the sentiment.
4. **Random Forest**: An ensemble model based on decision trees.
5. **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient-boosting algorithm that improves classification accuracy.

## Deep Learning Models
In addition to traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning models were also implemented:
1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Capturing sequential dependencies in text data.
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A variant of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and is better at capturing long-term dependencies in text.
3. **Bidirectional LSTM**: A more advanced version of LSTM that reads the text in both directions, improving sentiment classification.
4. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A state-of-the-art transformer-based model pre-trained on a large corpus, fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on various metrics:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified sentiments.
- **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ability of the model to identify all positive samples.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A summary of correct and incorrect classifications.

## Results
- Comparison of machine learning and deep learning models based on their accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Visualizations of the performance of different models, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- Highlighting which models performed best in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and generalization to unseen data.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the sentiment of financial news. It highlights the impact of different model architectures and features on sentiment classification accuracy. The insights gained can be used to predict how news might affect stock prices and assist in investment decision-making.
